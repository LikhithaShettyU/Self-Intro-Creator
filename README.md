# Self-Intro-Creator
Self Intro Project
This project aims to generate personalized self-introduction sections for various platforms, such as GitHub READMEs, social media profiles, or personal websites. The script allows users to input their name, qualifications, current role, company, and skills, and then generates a random self-introduction message based on this information.

How It Works
Input Information: Users are prompted to enter their name, qualifications, current role, company, and skills using the command line interface.

Generation of About Section: Based on the provided information, the script generates a random self-introduction message. The generated message includes a greeting, the user's name, position, company, degree, and skills.

Options for Action:

Copy to Clipboard (C): Copies the generated about section to the clipboard.
Save to File (S): Saves the generated about section to a text file named about_section.txt.
Both (B): Performs both actions (copying to clipboard and saving to file).

Dependencies
pyperclip library (for copying to clipboard)
PyCharm (optional) - Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python development.
